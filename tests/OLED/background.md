# Background: OLED Display for UAV Applications

## Introduction

Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) displays are compact, low-power, and highly readable display modules commonly used in embedded systems. While OLEDs are not always a critical component in UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) systems, they can serve as a valuable tool for debugging, monitoring key metrics, and making real-time adjustments during development or testing.

## Use Cases of OLED Displays in UAVs

1. **Telemetry Monitoring**:
   - OLEDs can display critical flight metrics such as altitude, speed, GPS coordinates, battery levels, and UAV status.
   - Useful for testing and calibration before fully integrating with ground control stations or apps.

2. **Debugging**:
   - During firmware development, an OLED can serve as a quick output device for debugging data, such as sensor readings, GPS fixes, or error messages.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - Display menu options for configuring the UAV, such as setting PID values, changing modes, or toggling features.

4. **Field Updates**:
   - OLEDs allow UAV operators to make firmware changes or configurations in the field without relying on external equipment like a laptop.

5. **Safety Notifications**:
   - Real-time display of warnings, such as low battery or connectivity issues.

## Benefits of Using OLED Displays
- **Compact Size**: Easy to integrate into the UAV's design.
- **Low Power Consumption**: Ideal for battery-operated systems.
- **High Contrast**: Readable in various lighting conditions.
- **Versatility**: Can display text, shapes, or graphics for enhanced functionality.
