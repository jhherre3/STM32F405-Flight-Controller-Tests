# Background: BME280 Sensor

## **What is the BME280?**

The BME280 is a compact and high-precision environmental sensor capable of measuring:

- **Temperature**: Measures ambient temperature with high accuracy.
- **Pressure**: Provides barometric pressure readings, useful for altitude estimation.
- **Humidity**: Monitors relative humidity for environmental awareness.

This sensor communicates via I2C or SPI interfaces, making it compatible with the STM32F405 and other microcontrollers.

## **Why Use the BME280 in UAVs and Drones?**

1. **Altitude Measurement:**
   - The BME280’s pressure readings can be converted into altitude data, which is crucial for:
     - Flight stabilization.
     - Navigation in autonomous systems.
     - Monitoring takeoff and landing dynamics.

2. **Environmental Awareness:**
   - Humidity and temperature readings help drones adapt to environmental conditions, such as:
     - Avoiding condensation on sensors or cameras.
     - Calibrating other onboard systems that rely on temperature.

3. **Compact and Lightweight:**
   - Its small size and low power consumption make it ideal for integration into UAV systems where weight and energy efficiency are critical.

## **How the BME280 Works**

1. **Sensing Capabilities:**
   - The sensor uses MEMS (Microelectromechanical Systems) technology for precise measurements of temperature, pressure, and humidity.
   - Outputs data in raw or human-readable formats via I2C or SPI.

2. **Pressure to Altitude Conversion:**
   - The BME280 provides barometric pressure readings that can be converted to altitude using the formula:
     ```
     Altitude = 44330 * (1 - (Pressure / SeaLevelPressure)^(1/5.255))
     ```
     - **SeaLevelPressure** is typically set to 1013.25 hPa, but it can be adjusted for local conditions.

3. **Interfaces:**
   - **I2C:** Simple two-wire communication (SDA, SCL).
   - **SPI:** Faster communication but requires additional pins.

## **Applications in UAVs**

1. **Autonomous Navigation:**
   - Use pressure data to determine the UAV's current altitude during flights.

2. **Weather Monitoring:**
   - Collect environmental data during missions to inform decisions or log data for research.

3. **Altitude Hold Mode:**
   - The BME280 can help drones maintain a steady altitude by providing accurate pressure readings to the flight controller.
