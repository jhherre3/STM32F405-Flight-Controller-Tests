## How the VL53L0X Works

The VL53L0X measures distance using Time-of-Flight (ToF) technology:
1. **Emit**: The sensor emits a short burst of infrared laser light.
2. **Reflect**: The light reflects off an object and returns to the sensor.
3. **Calculate**: The sensor calculates the distance based on the time it took for the light to return.

### Measurement Equation:
\[ d = \frac{c \cdot t}{2} \]
Where:
- \( d \): Distance to the object.
- \( c \): Speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, m/s \)).
- \( t \): Time taken for the light to travel to the object and back.

This approach ensures high accuracy, even in low-light conditions or with reflective surfaces.
