# Background: STM32 to ESP32 Communication for Wi-Fi Capabilities

## **Introduction**

This project demonstrates how to establish communication between an STM32 microcontroller and an ESP32 using UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter). By enabling data exchange between these two devices, we open the possibility of leveraging the ESP32's built-in Wi-Fi capabilities to extend the functionality of the STM32.

## **Why Connect STM32 to ESP32?**

The STM32 is a powerful microcontroller widely used in robotics, drones, and embedded systems for precise control and computation. However, it lacks native Wi-Fi capabilities. The ESP32, on the other hand, is a versatile microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, making it ideal for networking and IoT applications.

By connecting the STM32 to the ESP32, we can:
1. **Add Wi-Fi Connectivity**:
   - Enable the STM32 to send and receive data over the internet via the ESP32.
   - Use the ESP32 as a gateway to cloud services or remote control applications.

2. **Leverage the ESP32 for Networking**:
   - Host a web server or an API endpoint to interface with external devices.
   - Transmit sensor data collected by the STM32 to remote systems in real time.

3. **Enable Modular Design**:
   - Offload networking tasks to the ESP32 while the STM32 focuses on real-time control and computation.
   - Create scalable, modular systems where different microcontrollers handle specialized tasks.

## **How It Works**

1. **UART Communication**:
   - The STM32 sends data to the ESP32 using UART (TX from STM32 to RX of ESP32).
   - The ESP32 receives the data and processes it for further actions, such as forwarding it over Wi-Fi.

2. **Data Flow**:
   - The STM32 acts as the primary controller, sending commands or telemetry data to the ESP32.
   - The ESP32 can act as a Wi-Fi gateway, forwarding the data to a server or cloud application.

3. **Example Use Case**:
   - A drone uses the STM32 for motor and sensor control while the ESP32 transmits telemetry data (e.g., altitude, speed) to a remote monitoring station via Wi-Fi.

## **Applications**

1. **IoT Systems**:
   - Use the STM32 to interface with sensors or actuators and the ESP32 to send the data to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Firebase.

2. **Remote Monitoring**:
   - Monitor sensor data, system status, or telemetry from the STM32 over a Wi-Fi connection provided by the ESP32.

3. **Wireless Control**:
   - Implement wireless control of devices (e.g., drones, robots) by sending commands via the ESP32 and processing them on the STM32.

4. **Web Server Integration**:
   - The ESP32 can host a web server to display live data from the STM32, allowing remote users to interact with the system.

## **Future Extensions**

1. **Protocol Integration**:
   - Implement communication protocols like MQTT or HTTP on the ESP32 to integrate with cloud-based IoT systems.
   - Use MAVLink for drone telemetry and command transfer.

2. **Bidirectional Communication**:
   - Enable the ESP32 to send commands back to the STM32, allowing full-duplex communication for complex control systems.

3. **Advanced Applications**:
   - Stream live video or telemetry from the STM32 via the ESP32 for FPV drones.
   - Add Bluetooth communication via the ESP32 for local control.

## **Conclusion**

By establishing UART communication between the STM32 and ESP32, this project demonstrates a foundational step toward enabling Wi-Fi connectivity for STM32-based systems. This approach combines the strengths of both microcontrollers, creating a powerful and versatile platform for IoT, robotics, and UAV applications.
