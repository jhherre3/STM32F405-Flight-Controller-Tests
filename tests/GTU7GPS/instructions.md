## **How to Interpret GPS Output**

### **1. NMEA Sentences Overview**

GPS modules send data as standardized **NMEA sentences**, each containing specific information:
- **`$GPGGA`**: Provides positioning data like latitude, longitude, altitude, and fix quality.
- **`$GPRMC`**: Contains position, time, and motion-related data.
- **`$GPGSV`**: Reports satellite visibility and signal strength.
- **`$GPVTG`**: Displays speed and course over the ground.

## **Example GPS Output**

Below is an example of raw GPS output from the module:

## Breaking Down the Example Output

### `$GPGGA` Sentence

Raw Sentence: $GPGGA,060251.00,3327.79272,N,11140.88828,W,1,06,2.43,470.0,M,-27.5,M,,*66

Explanation:
- Field 1: `060251.00` - Time in UTC. The GPS data was recorded at 06:02:51.00.
- Field 2: `3327.79272,N` - Latitude in degrees and minutes. Latitude is `33°27.79272'N`.
- Field 3: `11140.88828,W` - Longitude in degrees and minutes. Longitude is `111°40.88828'W`.
- Field 4: `1` - Fix quality. A value of `1` means a valid GPS fix.
- Field 5: `06` - Number of satellites used in the fix. The module is using 6 satellites.
- Field 6: `2.43` - Horizontal Dilution of Precision (HDOP). A value of 2.43 indicates reasonable accuracy.
- Field 7: `470.0,M` - Altitude above mean sea level. The altitude is 470.0 meters.
- Field 8: `-27.5,M` - Geoidal separation. This is the difference between mean sea level and the WGS-84 ellipsoid.

Interpretation:
The GPS module has a valid fix with latitude `33.46321° N` and longitude `-111.68147° W`. The altitude is 470 meters, and the position is calculated using 6 satellites with an HDOP of 2.43.

### `$GPRMC` Sentence

Raw Sentence: $GPRMC,060240.00,A,3327.79289,N,11140.89037,W,0.0,60239.00,A,*71

Explanation:
- Field 1: `060240.00` - Time in UTC. The GPS data was recorded at 06:02:40.00.
- Field 2: `A` - Data status. A value of `A` indicates the data is valid.
- Field 3: `3327.79289,N` - Latitude in degrees and minutes. Latitude is `33°27.79289'N`.
- Field 4: `11140.89037,W` - Longitude in degrees and minutes. Longitude is `111°40.89037'W`.
- Field 5: `0.0` - Speed over ground in knots. The GPS module is stationary.
- Field 6: `60239.00` - Course over ground in degrees. This value is not meaningful in this case.
- Field 7: `A` - Mode indicator. A value of `A` indicates autonomous GPS mode.

Interpretation:
This sentence confirms the position as latitude `33.46321° N` and longitude `-111.68147° W`. The GPS module is stationary, with a speed of `0.0 knots`, and the data is valid.

### `$GPGSV` Sentence

Raw Sentence: $GPGSV,3,1,11,05,45,162,21,06,17,047,,11,57,033,26,12,77,185,19*7C

Explanation:
- Field 1: `3` - Total number of sentences for satellite data. There are 3 sentences in this set.
- Field 2: `1` - Sentence number. This is the first sentence of the 3.
- Field 3: `11` - Total number of satellites in view. The module can see 11 satellites.
- Satellite 1: `05,45,162,21` - Satellite ID 5 has an elevation of 45°, an azimuth of 162°, and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 21.
- Satellite 2: `06,17,047,` - Satellite ID 6 has an elevation of 17°, an azimuth of 47°, but no SNR value.
- Satellite 3: `11,57,033,26` - Satellite ID 11 has an elevation of 57°, an azimuth of 33°, and an SNR of 26.
- Satellite 4: `12,77,185,19` - Satellite ID 12 has an elevation of 77°, an azimuth of 185°, and an SNR of 19.

Interpretation:
The GPS module can see 11 satellites. Satellites with higher SNR values (e.g., 26, 21) contribute to the GPS fix, while satellites with no SNR are not used.

### `$GPVTG` Sentence

Raw Sentence: $GPVTG,T,M,0.391,N,0.724,K,A*29

Explanation:
- Field 1: `T,M` - Track/course over ground (not provided here).
- Field 2: `0.391,N` - Speed over ground in knots. The GPS module is moving at 0.391 knots.
- Field 3: `0.724,K` - Speed over ground in kilometers per hour. The GPS module is moving at 0.724 km/h.
- Field 4: `A` - Mode indicator. A value of `A` indicates autonomous GPS mode.

Interpretation:
The GPS module is moving slowly, with a ground speed of 0.724 km/h.
