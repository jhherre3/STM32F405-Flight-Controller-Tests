# STM32F405 Basic Setup and Test

This section is designed to help set up the STM32F405 with CircuitPython and verify its functionality. 

1. **Install CircuitPython** on the STM32F405 board. Put device in DFU mode for the f405 jumper wire from 3.3V to BO pin then flash on STM programmer. 
2. **Blink the onboard LED** to confirm GPIO functionality.
3. **Read serial output** to verify the board’s ability to communicate.

## **Purpose**

The purpose of these tests is to provide a baseline validation of the STM32F405. By completing this setup, we can ensure that:

- CircuitPython is correctly installed.
- The board can run basic Python scripts.
- Serial communication is functional for debugging and future development.

This setup serves as the foundation for further testing and integration with additional sensors or peripherals.

## **Quick Steps**

1. Install CircuitPython by flashing the appropriate firmware.
2. Use the onboard LED to verify basic GPIO control.
3. Set up a serial terminal (e.g., PuTTY) to read and debug output at 115200 baud rate.

Refer to this section whenever you need to validate the STM32F405’s core functionality before proceeding with more advanced tests.
